### Bitbucket install

1. Download Bitbucket Server
Download the installer - www.atlassian.com/software/bitbucket/download.

2. Run the installer
Run the installer. We recommend using a **Windows administrator account**.
Follow the prompts to install Bitbucket. You'll be asked for the following info:
Type of Bitbucket instance - the type of installation, for these instructions select Standard. 

If you're installing Data Center on a single node, also choose Standard, because this type comes with a bundled Elasticsearch instance and is suitable for a non-clustered Data Center deployment. In the Data Center type, you would need to install it separately.

Installation directory - where Bitbucket will be installed.
Home directory - where Bitbucket application data will be stored.
TCP ports - the HTTP connector port and control port Bitbucket will run on.
Once the installer completes launch Bitbucket in a browser.
Set up Bitbucket
The Setup Wizard runs automatically when you visit Bitbucket Server in your browser the first time
